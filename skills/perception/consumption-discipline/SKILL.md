description: "Structured exposure habits for building taste through relentless, intentional consumption. Not passive scrolling. Active intake across design, architecture, film, music, food, and culture. Use when building a taste practice, advising on professional development, or diagnosing why someone's design range feels narrow."

# Consumption Discipline

Great taste is built through relentless exposure. You can't taste what you've never tasted.

## How to use

- `/consumption-discipline` Apply structured consumption constraints to professional development in this conversation.

## Constraints

### The Core Rule
- MUST consume more than you create. The ratio matters. If you're only making and never absorbing, your taste ceiling is whatever you already know.
- MUST consume actively, not passively. Scrolling Dribbble is passive. Spending 10 minutes deconstructing one design is active.
- MUST consume across domains. Design is the obvious input. Architecture, film, food plating, fashion, music production, editorial print, industrial design are the non-obvious inputs that widen your range.
- NEVER consume from a single source. If all your references come from one platform, one country, or one decade, your taste has a monoculture problem.

### Consumption Structure
- MUST balance breadth and depth: wide exposure builds range, deep study builds understanding
- Breadth: 3-5 new products, spaces, or artifacts per week from domains you don't normally visit
- Depth: 1 extended study per week (30+ minutes deconstructing a single piece of work)
- SHOULD schedule consumption like you schedule workouts. It doesn't happen on its own.
- SHOULD track what you consume. A simple log reveals your blind spots over time.

### What to Consume
- Screen: products you'd never use, from markets you don't serve, in languages you don't speak
- Physical: museum exhibitions, retail stores, hotel lobbies, restaurant interiors, packaging
- Temporal: work from the 1950s, 1970s, 1990s. Design principles don't expire. Understanding how the same problems were solved in different eras gives you range no amount of contemporary exposure can.
- Cultural: design from Japan, Brazil, Netherlands, Nigeria, India, Switzerland. Every design culture has principles the others haven't discovered.
- Adjacent: film editing, music composition, food presentation, fashion construction, architecture. The principles transfer. The aesthetics don't have to.

### Active vs. Passive Consumption
- Passive: scrolling a feed, saving a screenshot, saying "that's cool"
- Active: naming 3 specific decisions, writing one sentence about why it works, tagging it by principle
- MUST convert passive consumption to active. The difference is whether you walk away with an observation or just a feeling.

### Anti-Patterns
- Consuming only from your own industry (creates an echo chamber)
- Consuming only contemporary work (creates trend-dependency)
- Consuming without documenting (creates the illusion of learning without retention)
- Binge-consuming once a month instead of consistent daily exposure
- Treating consumption as procrastination instead of practice (it's practice when it's structured)
