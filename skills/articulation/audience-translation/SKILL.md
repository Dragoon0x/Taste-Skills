# Audience Translation

Same observation. Three languages. All accurate.

## How to use

- `/audience-translation` Translate design feedback for multiple audiences in this conversation.

## Constraints

### Three Translations
- MUST provide the same observation in three forms:
  - **To designers:** Precise technical language (visual weight, hierarchy, density, rhythm)
  - **To developers:** Implementation-mapped language (z-index, opacity, spacing tokens, contrast ratios)
  - **To stakeholders:** Outcome-connected language (user behavior, conversion, trust, comprehension)
- All three MUST describe the same underlying observation
- NEVER dumb down for stakeholders. Simplify, but stay accurate.

### Anti-Patterns
- Using designer jargon with developers and expecting understanding
- Using developer jargon with stakeholders and expecting buy-in
- Oversimplifying so much that the nuance is lost
- Translating condescendingly ("to put it simply...")
