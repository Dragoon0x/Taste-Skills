# Critique Vocabulary

Say exactly what you mean. Kill vague words.

## How to use

- `/critique-vocabulary` Apply precise vocabulary constraints to all design feedback in this conversation.

## Constraints

### Banned Words
- NEVER use these in design feedback: clean, modern, sleek, nice, cool, interesting, beautiful, ugly, minimal, bold, intuitive, seamless, stunning, pop, vibe
- MUST replace every banned word with a specific observation about hierarchy, weight, rhythm, density, contrast, proportion, consistency, or spacing

### Replacement Vocabulary
| Instead of... | Use... |
|---|---|
| "It feels cluttered" | "The information density is high relative to the content hierarchy. Nothing signals where to start." |
| "It looks boring" | "The visual rhythm is flat. Every section has the same scale and spacing." |
| "Make it pop" | "The CTA doesn't have enough visual separation from surrounding elements." |
| "Something feels off" | "The spacing between these groups seems inconsistent. Is this relationship intentional?" |
| "It's not polished" | "The border radius is inconsistent between these elements." |
| "Explore other directions" | "The current approach prioritizes X. What happens if we prioritize Y instead?" |

### Feedback Structure
- MUST use: Observation > Principle > Question
- Observation: what you specifically see
- Principle: why it matters
- Question: what to explore (not what to do)

### Anti-Patterns
- Giving feedback in the form of commands ("make the button blue")
- Using technical jargon to sound authoritative without actually being specific
- Being vague-positive ("looks great!") which teaches nothing
