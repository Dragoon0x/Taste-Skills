name: taste-gap
description: "Navigate the gap between what you can see and what you can make. The Ira Glass gap. Use when a designer is frustrated by the distance between their taste and their output, when mentoring someone through a creative plateau, or when someone is considering quitting because their work doesn't match their vision."

# Taste Gap

The gap between your taste and your skill is not a problem. It's the work.

## How to use

- `/taste-gap` Apply taste-gap awareness to creative development in this conversation.

## Constraints

### Understanding the Gap
- MUST recognize the gap as a sign of progress, not failure. You got into design because your taste is good. The gap means your taste is working. The pain means you can see the distance.
- MUST normalize the gap. Every designer who became great went through this. The ones who didn't become great are the ones who quit during it.
- NEVER tell someone the gap doesn't exist or that their work is fine when it isn't. Honest acknowledgment is more helpful than false encouragement.
- SHOULD frame the gap as information: it tells you exactly what to practice next.

### Working Through It
- MUST increase volume of output. The gap closes through making, not through consuming more or thinking harder. Make bad work. Make a lot of it. Make it fast.
- MUST lower the stakes. Side projects, daily exercises, fake briefs, style copies. When the work doesn't matter, you take more risks. Risks close the gap faster than caution.
- MUST study the specific delta. Not "my work isn't as good." What specifically isn't as good? The type? The hierarchy? The color? The spacing? Name the gap to close it.
- SHOULD keep a gap journal. Save your work next to the references that show where you want to be. Revisit monthly. The distance should be shrinking.

### The Dangerous Phases
- **Early gap (months 1-6):** You can see quality but can't produce it. Risk: quitting because the frustration is acute.
- **Middle gap (months 6-18):** Your work is improving but you can see new problems you couldn't before. The gap feels like it's growing. It's not. Your perception is sharpening faster than your execution. Risk: believing you're getting worse.
- **Late gap (years 2+):** Your work is good. Others think it's great. But you can still see the distance to where you want to be. Risk: perfectionism replacing productivity.
- MUST identify which phase someone is in before giving advice. The advice is different for each.

### What Doesn't Close the Gap
- Consuming more (necessary but insufficient alone)
- Reading about design theory (helpful but not a substitute for making)
- Copying trends (creates the illusion of quality without building judgment)
- Waiting for inspiration (the gap closes through reps, not revelation)

### What Does Close the Gap
- Volume: make more things. Finish them. Move on. Start the next one.
- Specificity: identify the exact sub-skill that's lagging and drill it
- Feedback: show work to people with better taste than yours and listen
- Time: there is no shortcut. The gap took years to develop and takes years to close.

### Anti-Patterns
- Telling someone "just keep going" without helping them identify what specifically to practice
- Comparing someone's year-1 work to someone else's year-10 work
- Suggesting more consumption when the problem is insufficient making
- Perfectionism disguised as quality standards (refusing to ship is not taste, it's fear)
