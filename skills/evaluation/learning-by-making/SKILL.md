# Learning by Making

Taste is sharpened by making, failing, and making again. Not by watching.

## How to use

- `/learning-by-making` Apply making-as-practice constraints to creative development in this conversation.

## Constraints

### The Volume Principle
- MUST prioritize quantity of finished work over quality of any single piece
- A designer who ships 50 projects in a year learns more than one who perfects 3
- MUST finish things. Unfinished work teaches you how to start. Finished work teaches you how to decide.
- NEVER let "it's not ready" become permanent. Set a deadline. Ship it. Learn from the gap between what you shipped and what you wished you'd shipped.

### Deliberate Practice Formats
- **Speed rounds (15-30 min):** Redesign a real product screen. No research. No moodboard. Just instinct. What comes out reveals your current taste baseline.
- **Style copies (60 min):** Recreate someone else's design decision-for-decision. Not pixel-copying. Understanding why every choice was made by making it yourself.
- **Constraint challenges (45 min):** One typeface, one color. 320px width only. Zero images. 10 words max per screen. Constraints strip away crutches and expose your actual judgment.
- **Fake briefs (2-4 hours):** Invent a product. Design it end-to-end. Landing page, onboarding, core screen, settings. The act of making complete decisions across a whole product builds holistic taste.
- **Remix exercises (30 min):** Take something you made last month. Redesign it from scratch without looking at the original. Compare the two. The delta is your growth.

### Rules of Making
- MUST make things even when they're bad. Especially when they're bad. Bad work with reflection teaches more than good work by accident.
- MUST reflect after making. "What worked? What didn't? What would I change with 2 more hours?" Without reflection, volume is just busywork.
- MUST vary the format. If you only design landing pages, your taste is landing-page-shaped. Design dashboards, mobile apps, emails, posters, packaging, signage.
- SHOULD share work publicly. The vulnerability of showing imperfect work accelerates growth because it forces you to articulate your decisions.

### The Failure Requirement
- MUST reframe failure as data. A design that doesn't work tells you exactly what you don't understand yet.
- SHOULD keep a failure archive. Save your worst work. Revisit it quarterly. When you can articulate why it's bad in precise language, you've grown.
- NEVER delete bad work. It's your most honest record of where you were.

### Anti-Patterns
- Analyzing 10 products for every 1 you make (consumption-to-creation ratio is inverted)
- Only making things in your comfort zone (safe projects don't stretch taste)
- Abandoning projects when they get hard (the hard part is where the learning is)
- Waiting for the perfect brief to start making (the brief doesn't matter, the reps do)
- Treating practice work as throwaway (practice work should be finished and reflected on)
