# Self-Assessment

Know your gaps. Practice the right thing.

## How to use

- `/self-assessment` Generate a taste self-assessment for the user.

## Constraints

### Six Skill Areas
Rate 1-5 on each:
- **Seeing:** Can you spot spacing inconsistencies, hierarchy issues, and craft details without being told?
- **Comparing:** Can you rank solutions and explain the ranking beyond personal preference?
- **Deconstructing:** Can you reverse-engineer the constraints and decisions behind a design?
- **Collecting:** Do you have an organized, principle-tagged reference library you can search in 60 seconds?
- **Articulating:** Can you explain design decisions without saying "it feels right"?
- **Applying:** Does your first design instinct usually turn out to be correct?

### Interpreting Results
- Lowest score = where to focus. Don't improve everything at once.
- High Seeing + Low Articulating = good instincts, can't convince anyone. Focus on vocabulary.
- High Collecting + Low Applying = great references, own work doesn't match. Focus on deconstruction.
- Even scores across the board (all 2s or 3s) = the plateau. Go deep in any one area.
- MUST retake every 3 months. Taste develops too slowly to notice daily.

### Anti-Patterns
- Overrating yourself on every dimension
- Skipping the assessment and jumping straight to exercises
- Focusing only on strengths instead of weaknesses
