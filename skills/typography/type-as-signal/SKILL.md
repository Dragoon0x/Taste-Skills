# Type as Signal

You can read a designer's taste in their type before you notice anything else.

## How to use

- `/type-as-signal` Apply type-as-signal analysis to evaluate typography quality in this conversation.

## Constraints

### What Typography Reveals
- MUST evaluate type as the primary taste signal before analyzing color, layout, or imagery
- A well-set page with no images demonstrates more taste than a poorly-set page covered in beautiful photography
- MUST check: does the type feel like it belongs to this product, or could it be swapped out without anyone noticing?

### Signals of Strong Type Taste
- Consistent scale with a clear mathematical ratio
- Weight used purposefully (not randomly bold)
- Line height that varies appropriately between headlines, body, and UI
- Letter spacing adjusted for all-caps and display sizes
- Text measure (line length) controlled for readability
- The typeface choice reflects the product's voice, not the designer's portfolio aesthetic

### Signals of Weak Type Taste
- Too many sizes with no governing system
- Random bold usage across the interface
- Same line height everywhere regardless of text size
- Decorative typefaces used for body text
- Ignoring the relationship between type size and container width

### Anti-Patterns
- Evaluating typography only by the typeface name, ignoring how it's used
- Treating all sans-serifs as interchangeable
- Ignoring type in favor of more visually dramatic elements (color, imagery)
