# Type Selection

Every typeface carries cultural and emotional information. Choose based on what it says, not what's popular.

## How to use

- `/type-selection` Apply type selection constraints to this conversation.

## Constraints

### Selection Criteria
- MUST choose based on the product's voice, not current trends
- MUST evaluate how the typeface performs at the sizes it will actually be used (body, UI labels, headlines)
- MUST consider the full character set needed (language support, special characters, numerals)
- NEVER choose a typeface because it's trending without evaluating fit
- SHOULD limit to 1-2 typefaces. If you can't explain why you need two, use one.

### What Typefaces Communicate
- Geometric sans (Inter, Circular, Futura): precision, modernity, tech-forward. The default means using one says nothing. How you USE it does.
- Humanist sans (Source Sans, Lato): warmth, approachability, readability
- Neo-grotesque (Helvetica, Suisse): neutrality, professionalism, institutional
- Serif (Georgia, Freight): authority, editorial quality, timelessness
- Monospace (JetBrains Mono, Berkeley Mono): technical credibility, precision
- Display/Variable (Clash, Cabinet): personality, distinctiveness. Only work when the system supports them.

### Pairing Rules
- MUST create clear contrast when pairing: scale, style, or weight contrast
- One typeface used well beats two typefaces used carelessly
- NEVER pair two medium-weight faces. Push the difference.

### Anti-Patterns
- Choosing a typeface because a product you admire uses it (context matters)
- Using decorative typefaces for body text
- Picking from "trending fonts" lists without evaluating fit
