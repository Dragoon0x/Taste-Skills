# Principle Tagging

Tag by what it teaches, not what it looks like.

## How to use

- `/principle-tagging` Apply principle-based tagging to references in this conversation.

## Constraints

### Tagging Rules
- MUST tag by principle: "hierarchy-through-scale-contrast" not "dark UI"
- MUST complete this sentence for every reference: "This is a good example of ___"
- NEVER tag by aesthetic alone: "gradient", "minimal", "dark mode" are useless tags
- SHOULD include one sentence about why this reference was saved

### Principle Tag Categories
- Hierarchy: hierarchy-through-scale, hierarchy-through-color, hierarchy-through-weight, hierarchy-through-space
- Space: density-with-clarity, generous-whitespace, rhythm-through-spacing, vertical-rhythm
- Type: type-as-primary-texture, type-scale-contrast, type-restraint
- Color: restrained-palette, color-as-wayfinding, neutrals-with-accent, color-meaning
- Motion: motion-as-feedback, subtle-transitions, spatial-continuity, motion-restraint
- Interaction: progressive-disclosure, direct-manipulation, keyboard-first, smart-defaults

### Anti-Patterns
- Saving references without any tag at all
- Using more than 3 tags per reference (if everything applies, nothing is specific)
- Tagging with trend names instead of principle names
