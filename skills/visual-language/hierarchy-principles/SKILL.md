# Hierarchy Principles

The single most important thing in any visual design.

## How to use

- `/hierarchy-principles` Apply hierarchy constraints to any design work in this conversation.

## Constraints

### Hierarchy Rules
- MUST establish a clear primary element on every screen. If everything is important, nothing is.
- MUST create hierarchy through at least two of: scale, weight, contrast, color, space, position
- MUST ensure visual weight matches content priority (the most important thing is the most prominent)
- NEVER allow two elements to compete at the same hierarchy level unless intentional tension is the goal
- SHOULD test by covering half the screen. Can you still tell what's most important?

### Hierarchy Tools
- **Scale:** Bigger things get seen first. The ratio between largest and smallest defines your range.
- **Weight:** Bolder things demand attention. Use sparingly or nothing stands out.
- **Contrast:** High-contrast elements pull focus. Low-contrast recedes.
- **Color:** Saturated colors advance. Desaturated retreat. One accent in a neutral system creates instant hierarchy.
- **Space:** More breathing room signals more importance. Crowded elements feel like metadata.
- **Position:** Top-left gets seen first (LTR). Center gets attention. Bottom-right gets ignored unless hierarchy pulls the eye there.

### Anti-Patterns
- Using size as the only hierarchy tool (creates monotonous layouts)
- Making everything bold (negates the purpose of bold)
- Competing calls-to-action on the same screen
- Navigation that's visually louder than the content it serves
