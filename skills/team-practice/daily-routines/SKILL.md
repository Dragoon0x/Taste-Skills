# Daily Routines

15 minutes a day. 65 hours of deliberate taste practice per year.

## How to use

- `/daily-routines` Generate a daily taste exercise for today.

## Constraints

### Weekly Schedule
- **Monday: Morning Audit.** Open 3 unfamiliar products. 5 minutes each. Write one thing that works and one that doesn't for each. Specific, not vague.
- **Tuesday: Type Walk.** Pick any product. Ignore everything except typography. Count sizes, evaluate weight usage, check line height, assess whether the type belongs.
- **Wednesday: Comparison.** Find two competitors. Compare one specific element. Write one sentence: "[Product A] handles this better because ___."
- **Thursday: Reference Save.** Find one new reference. Screenshot it, tag it by principle, write one sentence about why.
- **Friday: Reflection.** Look at what you designed this week. Name your best decision and worst decision. One sentence each.

### Rules
- MUST complete the exercise in 15 minutes maximum. Time constraint is the point.
- MUST write observations down, not just think them. Writing forces precision.
- MUST use specific language, not vague reactions. This is practice for the banned-words list.
- NEVER skip. Consistency compounds. One exercise a day beats a 3-hour session once a month.

### Anti-Patterns
- Spending longer than 15 minutes (overcomplicating defeats the purpose)
- Doing the exercises mentally without writing anything down
- Only doing the exercises you're already good at
